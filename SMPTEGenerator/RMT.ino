// We need a very steady stream of 80 bit frames going to the clocks; at
// a rate of 2400 bits per second (30 fps x 80 bits).
//
// This is a bit fast for bit-banging; not in the least as network traffic
// and similarly would cause us regularly to halt for a few 10's of mSeconds.
// Which makes the 'error' LED of the clocks to go blinken.
//
// As the ESP uart insists on a stop-bit - abusing that is not an option either.
//
// We cannot use the RMT system 'as is' -- as it takes to long at the end of a
// 80 bit cycle to re-prime it with the next number and not 'loose a beat'.
//
// We also cannot re-prime it during an interrupt - as that seems to make the
// Wifi less stable.

// So we use the harware based RMT system in typical, game console, `two buffer',
// mode with one buffer getting written out; the other being prepared. And
// defer the filling to the main loop. And therefore we'll make the buffers
// fairly big - so a burt of network traffic does not cause issues.
//
// Unfortunately - the RMT subsystem gets confused if we do not fill it completely
// while in looping mode (i.e. padding it after the 80 bits with the typical 'end
// sentinel' works in single shot; but in loop-mode will cause glitches).
//
// And professional broadcast clocks are senitive enough to notice. Drat.
//
// We'll solve this by always filling things up to a RMT_MEM_ITEM_NUM boundary;
// and carrying over the remaining bits into the block filled at the next interrupt.
//
// Which means we make it fairly hard to do frame level syncing from NTP. We'll
// punt on this -as our NTP lacks the usuuals Phased Locked Loop code anyway.
